This is a stub Android directory to satisfy CI environments that attempt to invoke Gradle builds.
It does not represent a real native Android project.

- `gradlew` is a stub that exits successfully.
- `build.gradle` defines no-op assemble tasks.
- For real native builds, run `expo prebuild --platform android` in a proper environment, which will generate a full Android project.
